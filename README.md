- remove scroll glow
- Code refactoring
    - Use themes (and dark mode)
- Reduce number of Firebase reads
- Statistics page
    - add page indicator
    - streaks for meeting daily goals
    - Lifetime summaries
- Add page
    - User should be able to tap category to add an entry directly without having to select in the add screen
- Settings Page
    - Allow user to choose between keeping or deleting log data when removing a category
    - Allow user to give each category a color (for graphs and other widgets)
- First time user landing page
   
- Figure out how to optimize code (Adding any more features causes noticeable lag)

    - Category and current goal data should be stored directly in the user document, finish changing the code to fit that
    - Switch most usages of FirebaseUser to AppUser
