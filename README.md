    - Graph should scale properly with data
    - streaks for meeting daily goals
    - percentage of days meeting daily goals

- DARK MODE!!!!
- Move hours and minutes sliders to the bottom for better ergonomics
- Log page
    - confirm delete log entry
    - undo delete log entry
- Firebase support
- Goal page
    - Current goals should be displayed rather than just an empty text field
- Settings Page

BUGS
