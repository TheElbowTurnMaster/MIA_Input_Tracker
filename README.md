MIA Input Tracker Todo List (Not in any particular order of importance)

- Code refactoring
    - Use themes (and dark mode)
- Reduce number of Firebase reads
- Statistics page
    - add page indicator
    - streaks for meeting daily goals
    - Lifetime summaries
- Settings Page
    - Allow user to choose between keeping or deleting log data when removing a category (Might cost too many Firestore deletes to implement)
- First time user landing page
   
- Figure out how to optimize code (Adding any more features causes noticeable lag)
